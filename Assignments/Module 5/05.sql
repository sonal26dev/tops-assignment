Question- 05 What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
Answer= 
• Data redundancy occurs when the same piece of data is stored in two or more separate places and is a common occurrence in many businesses. 
• As more companies are moving  away from siloed data to using a central repository to store information,  they are finding that their database is filled with inconsistent duplicates of the same entry. 
• Although it can be challenging to reconcile — or even benefit from — duplicate data entries, understanding how to reduce and track data redundancy efficiently can help mitigate long-term inconsistency issues for your business. 
• A database is a systematic collection of data stored electronically on a computer in which a database management system (DBMS) controls and can manipulate the stored data.
• Data redundancy is when an organization stores the same data in multiple places at the same time. 
• It may occur within many fields in one database or across multiple technological platforms.
• Data redundancy can occur in databases and file-based storage systems.

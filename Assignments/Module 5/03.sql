3> No relationship between data.	
4> Normalization is not present.	
5> DBMS does not support distributed database.	
6> It stores data in either a navigational or hierarchical form.	
7> It deals with small quantity of data.	
8> Data redundancy is common in this model.	
9> It is used for small organization and deal with small data.	
10> It supports single user.	
11> Data fetching is slower for the large amount of data.	
12> The data in a DBMS is subject to low security levels with regards to data manipulation.	
13> Low software and hardware necessities.	
14> Examples: XML, Window Registry, etc.	

••• RDBMS •••
1> RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
2> Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
3> Data is stored in the form of tables which are related to each other.

7> It deals with large amount of data.
8> Keys and indexes do not allow Data redundancy.
9> It is used to handle large amount of data.
10> It supports multiple users.
11> Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
12> There exists multiple levels of data security in a RDBMS.
13> Higher software and hardware necessities.
14> Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access etc.
